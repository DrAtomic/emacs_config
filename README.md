# My emacs config

## Description

I wanted access to my emacs config across multiple platforms

only works for linux

emacs 27.2

## Installation

### get the code
```
git clone https://github.com/DrAtomic/emacs_config.git
```

### move into directory
```
cd emacs_config
```

### install script
all this does is rename your old ~/.emacs.d/init.el to ~/.emacs.d/old\_init.el and the same with ~/.emacs.d/config.org to ~/.emacs.d/old\_config.org

```
bash install.sh
```

### start emacs
start emacs and everything should be good to go. :)

(there are some warnings after compilation but they can be safely ignored)
